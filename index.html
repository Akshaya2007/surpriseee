            Day starts with "Good Morning" text,
Waiting for you to wake up and reply next.
We talk for a while and then go away
Just to get into our day. 


The day just passes with time,
Waiting for the text during nighttime.
The messaging makes face light,
Things you share makes night bright.


The day ends with "Good Night",
Dreams have been in such good sight.
I know this is the beginning,
This feels like a winning.


Will surely do fun,
After the schooling is done.
I promise,
Will be through your worst and best
Are you willing to accept??
